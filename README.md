## Debug ğŸ¦†

to serve as mental "checkpoints" in between periods of work I have 2 debug duck files both in the front end directory and back end directory. In these files I keep note of what I am doing, what I am thinking, and what I have to do.

- [backend ğŸ¦†](./server/debug_ğŸ¦†.md)
- [frontend ğŸ¦†](./server/debug_ğŸ¦†.md)
