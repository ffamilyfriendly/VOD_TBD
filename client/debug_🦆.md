## Ramble

### Pain

front end is pain bros

## needs doing

- [x] fix edit content screen with grid so it looks _nicer_
- [ ] add some sort of way to display errors outside of console. Maybe toasts with global context?
  - [ ] add styling (error/success/warning/info) to toasts
  - [ ] add auto-dismissal
  - [ ] add user required dismissal
  - [ ] add toast error handling to places where I have no error handling
- [ ] add way to "search" tmdb results for auto updating movie meta and for creating series from tmdb id
- [ ] (maybe) add a way to create the series structure manually? Dont see much use as most worthwhile series are found on tmdb already
- [x] add way to add tags to entities
- [ ] get working on the "watch" page
