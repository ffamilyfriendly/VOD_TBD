## Ramble

### Pain

front end is pain bros

## needs doing

- [] fix edit content screen with grid so it looks _nicer_
- [] add some sort of way to display errors outside of console. Maybe toasts with global context?
- [] add way to "search" tmdb results for auto updating movie meta and for creating series from tmdb id
- [] (maybe) add a way to create the series structure manually? Dont see much use as most worthwhile series are found on tmdb already
- [] add way to add tags to entities
- [] get working on the "watch" page
